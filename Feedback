Web application - 57/75
* Application was reasonably ambitious, but the complicated part failed to be successfully implemented
* Application was sufficiently different from the tutorial in the book
* Some thought went into the design
* There are several errors:
  - readme database initialization missing key lines for set up
  - Sign in as guest does not do anything
  - Consistently refer to evil hangman. This is not evil hangman
  - Missing characteristics of enjoyable, playable game    
    - No hangman in the hangman game
    - No option to not play again

Presentation - 15/25, did not implement Evil Hangman, yet presented almost entirely on it
